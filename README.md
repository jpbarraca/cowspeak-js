Simple interpreter for the [COW esoteric language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW)

The objective was to develop the __SMALLEST__ COW interpreter compatible with ECS6. The code is not useful for anything real, and it is not supposed to be easy to understand. An ode to the details of JavaScript ECS6 totaling 460 bytes.

Part of the [Pixels Camp Challenges](https://pixels.camp)

## Usage

The code will declare a function named c which will process a string and write the output to another variable named STDOUT.

Check the example.
